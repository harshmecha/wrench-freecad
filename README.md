# wrench_freecad

This is a 3D model of a plain wrench created in FreeCAD software to be part of my CAD portfolio.



Features:
-Fully parametric design (sketch-driven)
-Properly constrained 2D profile
-Smoothed edges with fillets for realism



-Files Included:
-Wrench.FCStd  >  Native FreeCAD file
-Wrench-Body.step  >  STEP file for universal viewing
-Images(file)  >  Screenshots of the model
-i.s  >  Base sketch of the modal



Skills Practiced:
-Sketching with constraints
-Using Pad (Extrude) features
-Applying fillets for smoother geometry
